# Decoder
Code for operation of the decoder. 

## Structure
 - `decoder` - Contains the source code for the decoder (I hardly know her...).
 - `design_utils` - Contains safe utility functions.
 - `max78000_device` - Contains the autogenerated functions and data structures used by the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
 - `max78000_hal` - Contains the unsafe HAL utility functions and wrappers.
