# Purdue ECTF 2025
This repository contains all code related to Purdue3's (b01lers)  submission for ECTF 2025. 

## High-level overview
This project is a secure implementation of an embedded system for the MITRE eCTF challenge. Contestents were tasked with creating a system
to ensure the secure transmission of television frames through a satellite television distribution system. Teams were tasked with creating
an `encoder` to properly encode non-encrypted frames as well as a `decoder` to decrypt these frames. Frames are sent from the encoder to an 
uplink where they are then relayed to an organizer controlled satellite. The satellite broadcasts frames to all listening TVs; each teams' 
decoder is hooked up to a TV where it will accept encoded frames and then decode them if authorized to do so. 

## Documentation ðŸ“–
Documentation and technical specifications can be found in the [docs](docs) directory.

## Design Structure
 - `decoder` - Contains the source code for the secure decoder implementation.
 - `design` - Contains the encoder and necessary secret generation scripts. 
 - `tools` - Contains organizer created host tools that facilitate interaction between all components of the embedded system.
